I'd like to firstly welcome you to my brand new blog. I think It would be wise to introduce myself first. 

My fullname is Gareth Davies, however most call me Gaz. I'm 22 and have studied and worked as a web designer and programmer for most of my working career. I worked as a web developer for DC Thomson before taking a different career working with children. However, coding and web design have never been far away. 

Computers and websites have always interested me and I thought it'd be a good idea to pull all of those things together to make a blog. Now, I will say if you haven't already, I'm terrible at spelling and grammer, however all posts are being sent to someone who knows how to spell before they are published! :D. 

I built this blog using React-JS and NextJS. At the moment the site is version 1.0.0 but not to worry, more features and pages will be added, it's all learning for me!. 

I will post about pretty much anything to do with websites and anything else that's on my mind!. 

Have a great day!.

Gaz
